I don't think i need to include the javafx mvc framework in UML, and my uml put focus on my back end design.
1. use strategy pattern to model the interaction between entity and entity
2. state pattern use on some entity will change state
3. oberserver pattern to update UI (mojority of work is done by javafx)
